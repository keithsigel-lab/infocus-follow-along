* first we load the data in from a spreadsheet

clear
import delimited "/Users/keithsigel/Dropbox/Documents/Presentations/follow along/cats_cats_cats_2.csv"

* let's look at the dataset

browse

* we want to take a closer look at our cat_owner variable- we can tabulate this variable

tab cat_owner

* in this variable the value '1' means you own a cat while value '0' means you don't own a cat;
* we want to know if owning a cat was associated with dying in our study;

tab cat_owner died

* maybe not so helpful?
* how about if we get the proportions

tab cat_owner died, row

* was it significantly different? 

tab cat_owner died, row chi2

* Fewer cat owners died in our study. 
* But could this be for other reasons? Could it have been confounded?
* What was the age distribution for cat owners? And was it different by groups?

histogram patient_age
histogram patient_age, by(cat_owner)

ttest patient_age, by(cat_owner)

* remember - fewer cat owners died in our study;
* we want to see if it is related to confounders;
* so let's use a multivariable logistic regression model to see if it is an independent predictor;

* we put our dependent variable first in the model

logistic died cat_owner

* now an adjusted model, adjusting for age;
* including age, vitamin use, race/ethnicity (rac_reca: 1 = white, 2 = black, 3 = hispanic, 9=other);

logistic died cat_owner patient_age vitamins  i.rac_reca


* if we were interested instead in a continuous outcome = happiness stage "hst_stga" ;
* we use the stata command regress

regress hst_stga cat_owner

* and here multivariable

regress hst_stga cat_owner patient_age
